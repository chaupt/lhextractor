LHExtractor
by Christopher Haupt (chaupt@webvanta.com)

LHExtractor pulls tickets from a given Lighthouse Project's Milestone and dumps out a comma separated value stream to standard io (suitable for capturing to a file). 

Currently uses hard-coded field list for what is outputted as this is what we need to import into Pivotal Tracker.

This might be useful to someone looking to make the transition to Pivotal or just looking for an example using the Lighthouse API.

Install needed gems via: sudo gem install Caged-lighthouse-api, fastercsv (etc)

TODO
 - Specify fields and header from command line
 - General cleanup from what was admittedly a very fast hack
